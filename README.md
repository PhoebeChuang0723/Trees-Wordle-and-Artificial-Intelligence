# CSC111-Trees-Wordle-and-Artificial-Intelligence

A two-player variation of Wordle - Adversarial Wordle, which is one fundamental application of trees. 

Part 1: work with an Adversarial Wordle dataset and build an AI that makes random moves using this dataset as a guide

Part 2: develop a recursive algorithm for building up a complete game tree, exploring all possible Adversarial Wordle move sequences up to a given depth, and build a smarter AI that chooses moves based on estimated win probabilities

Part 3: develop one final Adversarial Wordle AI that starts with a completely empty game tree, but that builds up the tree as it plays more and more games, and balances using learned strategies from previous games and exploring new possibilities by making random choices
